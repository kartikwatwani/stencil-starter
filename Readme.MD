# Stencil Starter

Welcome to Stencil, stencil starter designed for seamless integration across various platforms including Stencil, Angular, and Vue. This document will guide you through the process of starting and optionally renaming the library, updating the repository origin, and setting up the development environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download and install them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your project:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/my-library.git
   cd my-library
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Renaming the Library

To rename the library from the default 'my-library' to your preferred name:

1. Run the rename command from the root directory:

   ```bash
   npx gulp default --name <new-library-name>
   ```

   Replace `<new-library-name>` with the name you want to assign to the library.

2. (Optional) To update the remote repository origin:
   ```bash
   npx gulp default --name <new-library-name> --origin <username/repo-path>
   ```
   Replace `<username/repo-path>` with your GitHub username and repository path.

### Example

If you renamed the library to `foo-library`, the core Stencil library will be named `foo-library` and the framework-specific libraries will be suffixed accordingly:

- Angular: `foo-library-angular`
- Vue: `foo-library-vue`

## Development Workflow

After renaming, the gulp task will automatically start watching the files for changes. You can continue developing and testing your changes across all integrated frameworks.
